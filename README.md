# Python-SystemCheckPC
Version: 3.0<br>
Description: A python program that checks the user's computer for basic statistics on CPU usage,
memory, disk usage and battery power. The program looks for CPU temp as well, but the script does
automatically work on Windows machines. It would have to be placed in the correct folder and run
with administrator rights.
